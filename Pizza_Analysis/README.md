# Pizza Sales Analysis


### Introduction

The goal of this project is to use SQL for data analysis and Power BI to create interactive visualizations using a pizza sales dataset.

We analyze pizza sales by various characteristics such as quantity, name, size, and category. 
We explore customer preferences for different types of pizza, identify the best-selling pizzas within each category, and analyze key metrics such as revenue, quantity, and size. 

In addition, the report provides insights into daily sales trends, sales by pizza category and size, and highlights the best-selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and total orders.

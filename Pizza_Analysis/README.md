# Pizza Sales Analysis


### Introduction

The goal of this project is to use SQL for data analysis and Power BI to create interactive visualizations using a pizza sales dataset.

We analyze pizza sales by various characteristics such as quantity, name, size, and category. 
We explore customer preferences for different types of pizza, identify the best-selling pizzas within each category, and analyze key metrics such as revenue, quantity, and size. 

In addition, the report provides insights into daily sales trends, sales by pizza category and size, and highlights the best-selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and total orders.

### Step followed

Data Acquisition: Imported the CSV dataset into a MySQL server to enable efficient querying.

Data Cleaning: The data is cleaned and transformed to correct inconsistencies, ensuring accurate analysis.

SQL Database Design and Querying: A structured database schema is created, and SQL queries are used to extract key insights such as total sales revenue, best-selling pizzas, customer trends, and busiest times for orders.

KPI Calculation: Key performance indicators (KPIs) like sales growth, average order value, and customer retention rates are calculated to assess store performance.

Power BI Dashboard Creation: The extracted insights and KPIs are visualized using interactive charts, graphs, and tables in a Power BI dashboard, allowing stakeholders to explore the data.

Insights and Recommendations: The analysis concludes with actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing the pizza store's operations and improving profitability.
